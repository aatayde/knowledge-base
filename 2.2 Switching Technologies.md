# 2.2 Switching Technologies

> Given a scenario, configure switching technologies and features.

## Virtual Local Area Network (VLAN)

- Segmentation:

- Logical Grouping:

- Traffic Isolation:

### VLAN database

- Central Configuration

- Consistency:

- Persistence:

### Switch Virtual Interface (SVI)

- Layer 3 Interface:

- Logical Interface:

- Gateway Functionality:

## Interface configuration

### Native VLAN

- Untagged Traffic:

- Compatibility:

- Default VLAN: typically configured as VLAN 1 but can be changed for security reasons

### Voice VLAN

- QoS Support:

- Priority Handling:

- Simplified Management:

### 802.1Q tagging

- VLAN Tagging:

- Trunking Protocol:

- 4-Byte Tag:

### Link aggregation

- Increased Bandwidth:

- Redundancy:

- Load Balancing:

### Switch Speed

- Varied Rates: Operates at different speeds such as 10 Mbps, 100 Mbps, 1 Gbps, 10 Gbps & higher

- Port Flexibility:

- Scaling:

### Duplex

- Full-Duplex:

- Half-Duplex:

- Collision Avoidance:

## Spanning Tree Protocol (STP)

- Loop Prevention:

- Redundant Paths:

- Convergence:

## Maximum transmission unit (MTU)

- Packet Size Limit:

- Efficiency: Optimizes network efficiency by reducing the need of fragmentation

- Varies by Medium: MTU size can vary depending on the network medium & protocols used.

### Jumbo frames

- Larger Packets: supports Ethernet Frames larger than the standard 1500 bytes, typically up to 9000 bytes

- Efficiency

- Performance
