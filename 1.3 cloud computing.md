# Cloud Computing

> Summarize cloud concepts and connectivity options

## Network functions virtualization (NFV)

> the process of creating a virtual process

### Virtualized Service

> NFV enables virtualized firewalls, load balancers, & routers, reducing physical hardware

### Scalability

> Network functions are deployed & managed through software adapting to change demands

### Cost Efficiency

> Reduces capital for dedicated hardware & allowing for more efficient use of resources

## Virtual private cloud (VPC)

### Isolated Environment

> a VPC provides an isolated secure network environment within a public cloud

### Customizable subnets

> users can create & manage subnets, routes, & gateways within the VPC

### Enhanced Security

> supports access control lists ACL & VPN connections to secure data

## Network security groups

### Traffic Filtering

> NSG filter inbound & outbound traffic based on specified rules, enhancing security

### Rule-Based Access Control

> Define rules based on IP addresses, port numbers, & protocols to control traffic flow

### Resources

> Resources: NSG can be applied to individual network interfaces or entire subnets, providing flexible security

## Network security lists

### Access control lists

#### Access Control

> control inbound & outbound traffic to subnets or network interfaces through a set of rules

### stateless filtering

> ACLs inspect each packet independently without maintaining session state

### Order-dependent rules

> the first matching rule determines whether traffic is allowed or denied

## Cloud gateways

### Internet gateway

#### Public internet access

> provides a scalable & available way in a VPC to access the internet

#### Redundancy & Availability

> Ensures high availability & redundancy for outbound internet traffic

#### Traffic management

> Manages & monitors the flow of internet-bound traffic to protect against threats

### Network address translation (NAT) gateway

## Cloud connectivity options

### Cloud VPN

> cloud Virtual Private Network

#### secure connectivity

> secure, encrypted connections between an on-premises network & a cloud VPC

#### Flexible Deployment

> supports site-to-site & client-to-site VPNs to meet different connectivity needs

#### integrated security

> integrates with cloud services to enhance the protection of data sent over the vpn

### Direct Connect

#### dedicated private connection

private connection between an on-premises data center & could provider (CSP)

#### performance

> offers lower latency & higher throughput compared to internet based connections

#### enhanced security

> reduces exposure to internet based threats, between on-premises and cloud

## Deployment models

### Public

#### Shared Resources:

> Public clouds offer computing services over the internet for multiple customers

#### Scalability:

> Provides virtually unlimited scalability with on-demand resource allocation

#### Cost-Effective:

> Typically offers a pay-as-you-go pricing model, reducing upfront costs

### Private

#### Exclusive use:

> dedicated to a single organization providing enhanced control & security

#### Customization

> allows for infrastructure & services tailored to specific business needs.

#### Compliance

> Adherence to regulatory & compliance requirements due to isolated resources

### Hybrid

#### Integrated Environments:

> combines public & private clouds, enabling data & application portability

#### Flexibility

> Offers the ability to scale workloads between private & public clouds based on demand

#### Cost Efficiency

> Public cloud resources for normal data while keeping sensitive data on private clouds

## Service models

### Software as a service (SaaS)

#### On-Demand software

> provides software applications over the internet, accessible through a web browser

#### Maintenance-Free

> The services provider manages all infrastructure, maintenance, & updates

#### Subscription model

> typically offered on a subscription basis reducing the need for large capital

### Infrastructure as a service (IaaS)

#### Virtualized Hardware

> provides virtual computing over the internet

#### Scalability

> allows for scalable resource allocation based on demand

#### user control

> users have control over the operating systems, storage, & deployment applications

### Platform as a service (PaaS)

#### Development

> provides a platform for developing, testing & deploying applications

#### Managed infrastructure

> the provider manages the server, storage, & networking

#### Rapid Development

> Rapid development & deployment of apps without hardware management

## Scalability

### Resource Adjustment

> allows systems to scale up or donwn in capacity to meet changing demands

## Elasticity

### Automatic scaling:

> automatically adjusts resource allocation in real-time based on current demands

### Dynamic resource management

> Ensures efficient use of resources without manual intervention

## Multi-Tenancy

### resource sharing

> Multiple customers share the same computing resources securely & efficiently

### Cost Savings

> Reduce costs through shared infrastructure & economies of scale
