- Layer 2: [Data Link](#data-link)
- Layer 3: [Network](#network)
- Layer 4: [Transport](#transport)
- Layer 5: [Session](#session)
- Layer 6: [Presentation](#presentation)
- Layer 7: [Application](#application)

## Physical

> Layer 1

### Data Unit

> Date Rate: Defined in bit rate (speed) of the transmission

- Bits

### Equipment

- Hub
- Network Cabling
- Repeater

### Physical topologies

- Star
- Ring
- Bus

## Data Link

> Layer 2

### Equipment

- Bridge
- Switch / Multilayer Switch = Router
- Network Adapter
- NIC

### Protocols

- ARP

### Data Unit

- Frame

### Features

#### Mac Addressing

> Media Access Control (MAC) address for hardware identification

- Mac Address = 48-bit identifier

#### Error Detection & Correction

> Implements error detection techniques such as Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC)

#### Frame Traffic Control

> Manages data frame flow control & sequencing between nodes on the same network segment.

## Network

> Layer 3

### Equipment

- Router

### Protocols

- ICMP
- IP

### Data Unit

- Packet

### Features

#### Logical Addressing

> Utilizes IP addresses for identifying devices on a network

#### Routing

> Determines the best path for the data to travel from source to destination across networks.

- Keep updated routing tables

#### Packet Switching

> Transfers data in packets and handles packet forwarding & routing

## Transport

> Layer 4

### Protocols

- UDP
- TCP

### TCP Protocol Data unit

- Segment

### UDP Protocol Data unit

- Datagram

### Features

#### Segmentation and Reassembly

> messages into smaller segments & reassembles at the destination

#### Flow Control

> Manages the rate of data transmissions to prevent network congestion

#### Error Recovery

> Provides mechanism for error detection & retransmissions (TCP) (UDP does not have this)

## Session

> Layer 5

> Create & terminate the ability for a device to communicate with a server, cloud or other device that is hosting a software application

### Responsibilities

> opening, closing and maintaining connections between applications

#### Session Creation

> Controls the dialog between two devices establishing, maintaining, & terminating sessions

#### Synchronization

> Manages data exchange between application by providing checkpoints for data recovery

#### Session Management

> Maintains session state & controls the dialog between devices

## Presentation

> Layer 6

### Responsibilities

> Data format translation, data compression, and data encryption/decryption

### Features

#### Data Translation

> converts formats between the application

#### Data Encryption and Decryption

> provides security through encryption & decryption

#### Data Compression

> Reduces the size of data optimize bandwidth usage

## Application

> Layer 7

### Protocols

- HTTP
- FTP
- SMTP

### Features

#### Application services

> network services directly to end-users, such as email, file transfer, & web browsing

#### API Access

> offers protocols & interfaces for application software to communicate over the network

#### Network Resource Sharing

> enables application to share resources like files & printers over the network
