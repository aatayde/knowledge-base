# 1.2 Network Appliances

> Compare and contrast networking appliances, applications, and functions

## Physical and virtual appliances

### Router

- OSI Layer 3

> keeps records of all data that goes to internal devices & to external networks & websites on the internet

#### Routing

> determines the best path for data to travel across different networks

#### Network Address Translation (NAT)

> Allows multiple devices on a local network to share a single public IP address

#### Interconnects Networks

> Connects multiple networks such as LANs WANs & the internet

### Switch

#### MAC Address Table

> Maintains a table to map MAC addresses to specific ports

#### VLAN Support

> segregates network traffic into virtual LANs for better traffic management and security

#### OSI Layer 2

> operates primarily at the data link layer, forwarding frames based on MAC addresses.

### Firewall

#### Traffic Filtering

> inspects incoming & outgoing traffic based on pre-configured security rules

#### Stateful Inspection

> tracks the sate of active connections based on context of traffic

#### Network Segmentation

> Divides network into segments to control traffic flow between them

### Intrusion detection system (IDS)

#### Traffic Monitoring

> continuously monitors network traffic for suspicious activity

#### Signature-Based Detection

> Uses known attack signatures to identify potential threats

#### Alert Generation

> Sends alerts to administrators about detection anomalies or intrusions

### Intrusion prevention system (IPS)

#### Active Threat Mitigation

> Not only detects nut also takes action to block or mitigate threats in real-time

#### Inline Deployment

> Placed directly in the data path to inspect & act on traffic as it flows through.

#### Behavioral Analysis

> Identified threats by analyzing traffic behavior & comparing it to baseline profiles

### Load balancer

#### Traffic Distribution

> Distributes incoming network traffic across multiple servers to ensure even load & reliability

#### Health Monitoring

> Continuously checks the health of servers to ensure traffic is only sent to operational servers

#### Scalability

> Enables easy addition or removal of servers to handle varying traffic loads

### Proxy

#### Content Filtering

> Controls user access to websites & content based on organizational policies

#### Anonymity

> Masks the internal IP addresses of user to enhance privacy & security

#### Caching

> Stores frequently accessed web content to reduce bandwidth usage & improve response times

### Network attached storage (NAS)

#### File-Level Storage

> Provides centralized storage that users can access over a network at the file level

#### Ease Of Access

> Allows multiple users & devices to share & access stored data concurrently

#### Data Protection

> Often includes feature like RAID for data redundancy & protection against disk failures

### Storage area network (SAN)

#### Block-Level Storage

> Provides high-speed block-level storage that appears to the host as local storage

#### High Performance

> Offers superior performance & low latency, suitable for enterprise applications

#### Scalability

> Easily scalable to add more storage as needed, supporting large data environments

### Wireless

#### Wireless Access point (WAP)

##### Wireless Connectivity

> Provides wireless network access to devices within a specific range using Wi-Fi standards

##### Network Bridging

> Connects wired & wireless segments of a network

##### Security Features

> supports various wireless security protocols such as WPA2/WPA3, to protect network access

#### Wireless Controller

##### Centralized Management

> Manages multiple wireless access points from a single interface

##### Seamless Roaming

> Ensures smooth handoff & connectivity as users move between access points

##### Security Enforcement

> Enforces security policies & performs IDS / IPS for the wireless network

## Applications

### Content delivery network (CDN)

#### Content Distribution

> Distributes web content & media to multiple servers in various geographic locations

#### Reduced Latency

> Minimizes delays in content delivery by using the closest available server to the user

#### Load Balancing

> Distributes traffic evenly across multiple servers to prevent overload & ensures reliability

## Functions

### Virtual private network (VPN)

#### Secure Communications

> Encrypts data between the user's devices & the VPN server, ensuring privacy & security

#### Remote Access

> Allows users to securely connect to a private network from remote locations

#### Anonymity & Privacy

> Masks the user's IP address, protecting browsing activities from eavesdroppers.

### Quality of service (QoS)

#### Traffic Prioritization

> Assigns priority levels to different types of networks traffic

#### Bandwidth Management

> Allocates network bandwidth to prevent congestion for essential services

#### Latency & Jitter Reduction

> Minimizes delays in packet delivery times, enhancing VoIP & video conferencing

### Time to live (TTL)

#### Packet Lifetime Control

> sets a limit on the number of hops (routers), preventing endless looping

#### Network Traffic

> Reduce congestion by ensuring misrouted packets are removed from the network

#### Diagnostic Utility

> Tools like traceroute show the path & measure the delay of packets across the network
