# 2.3 Network Types & Features

> Given a scenario, select and configure wireless devices and technologies.

## Channels

### Wireless Channels

- frequency bands:

- interface:

- Channel Selection:

- Regulated Use:

### Channel width

- Bandwidth Allocation: defines the width of the channel, 20 MHz, 40 MHz, 160 MHz

- Throughput Impact:

- Interference:

### Non-overlapping channels

- Non-Overlapping Channels

- 2.4 GHz Band: Offers 3 non overlapping channels (1, 6, 11) in the 2.4 GHz band.

- 5GHz band: Provides multiple non-overlapping channels in the 5 GHz band, improving performance

### Regulatory impacts

#### 802.11h

- Dynamic Frequency Selection (DFS): Use DFS to avoid interference with radar & priority devices

- transmit power control (TPC): Uses TPC to adjust transmit power levels & reduce interference.

- European Compliance:

## Frequency options

### 2.4GHz

- longer range: offers great range & pass through obstacles than higher frequencies
- low bandwidth: slower speeds due to limited spectrum & interference
- crowded spectrum: prone to interference from other devices like micro waves & bluetooth

### 5GHz

- higher bandwidth

- shorter range

- modern standards

### 6GHz

- new spectrum

- less congestion

- future proofing

### Band Steering

- connectivity:

- load balancing:

- management:

## Service set identifier (SSID)

- network identification:

- customizable:

- multiple SSID: allows multiple SSIDs on the same access point for different network segments

- Broadcast option: can be broadcast or hidden to a control network visibility

### Basic service set identifier (BSSID)

- unique identifier: provides a unique MAC address for each access point within a wireless network

- client association: helps clients identify & connect to the correct access point

- one per radio: each radio in an access point typically has its own BSSID

### Extended service set identifier (ESSID)

- extended network: combines multiple access points into a single logical network with a shared SSID

- seamless roaming: allows clients between access points with the same ESSID

- Network Management: simplifies by using a common identifier for multiple APs

## Network types

### Mesh networks

- redundant connections:
- self-healing:
- scalability:

### Ad hoc

- Decentralized
- Temporary setup
- peer-to-peer

### 5GHz

### Point to point

## Authentication

### Pre-shared key (PSK) vs. Enterprise

- Shared secret:
- Simple setup:
- Security Risk:

### Enterprise Authentication

- RADIUS Integration:

- Scalability:

- Strong Security:

## Antennas

### Omnidirectional vs. directional

- 360-Degree Coverage:
- Simple Deployment
- Indoor/Outdoor

### directional Antenna

- Focused Signal
- Targeted Coverage:
- Interference:

## Autonomous vs. lightweight access point

- Local Management:
- Flexibility:
- Self-Sufficient:
