# 1.6 Network Topologies

> Compare and contrast network topologies, architectures, and types.

## Mesh

- Redundant paths: every node connects to multiple nodes, providing redundancy & fault tolerance
- Robust:reliable communication by automatically rerouting traffic if a node or connection fails
- Complex setup: can be complex & expensive to set up due to large number of connections

## Hybrid

- combination: integrates multiple topologies (star, ring, mesh) to leverage the strength of each
- flexibility: offers greater flexibility & scalability to meet diverse network requirements
- complex design: can be more complex to design & manage compared to single-topology networks

## Star/hub and spoke

- Central Hub - all nodes connect to a central hub or switch, simplifying network management
- isolation of failures: a failure in one node or connection does not affect others, enhancing reliability
  Scalability: easy to add or remove nodes without disrupting the network

## Spine and leaf

- data center: a data center network design with a two-layer architecture for efficient, scalable networking
- Equal Paths: providing equal paths between any two leaf switches, ensuring low-latency communication
- Scalability: easily scalable by adding more spine or leaf switches without major changes

## Point to point

- Direct connection: direct link between two network devices, ensuring dedicated communication
- High Performance: provides low-latency communication between the two points
- Simple configuration: simple to set u and manage, ofter used for short-distance connections

## Three-tier hierarchical model

### Core Layer

- High-Speed backbone: the backbone of the network, providing high-speed, high-capacity data transmission
- Centralized Routing: facilitates fast & efficient routing between different parts of the network
- Minimal Processing: focuses on speed & reliability with minimal data processing & packet manipulation

### Distribution

- Policy: an intermediary between the core & access layers, implementing policies & routing
- aggregation point: aggregates data from the access layer before forwarding it to the core layer
- Network Security: Enforces security policies & performs traffic management functions

### Access

- User Connectivity: provides direct connectivity to end user devices & network resources
- Switching & Security: handles local switching & access control to ensure secure connections
- Network Services Provides essential network services such as DHCP, VLANs, & PoE

## Collapsed core

- combined layers: integrates core & distribution layers into a single layer network design
- cost-effective: reduces the cost & complexity of the network by consolidating functions
- small networks: often used in smaller networks where a three-tier design is unnecessary

## Traffic flows

### North-south

- External Communications: traffic between internal network devices & external networks (internet)
- Data center Entry/Exit: common in data centers, including data entering or leaving the data center
- Vertical Flow: typically flows vertically through the network layers (access, distribution, core)

### East-west

- internal communication: traffic between devices within the same network or data center
- Lateral Flow: flows horizontally, staying within the same network layer or between similar layers
- High-Volume: Often higher in volume in modern data centers due to server-to-server communications
