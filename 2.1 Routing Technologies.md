# 2.1 Routing Technologies

> Explain characteristics of routing technologies

## Static routing

- manual configuration: routes manually configured by network admins, offering precise control.

- no overhead: no additional protocol overhead as no routing updates exchanged.

- stable & predictable: routes remain constant unless manually changed, providing stability

## Dynamic routing

- automatic updates: routies are updated & adjusted based on network topology changes.

- scalable: suitable for large complex networks due to automatic route management

- protocols: utilizes protocols like OSPF, EIGRP, & BGP to exchange routing information

### Border Gateway Protocol (BGP)

- internet routing: used for routing between different autonomous systems on the internet

- path vector protocol:

- scalability:

### Enhanced Interior Gateway

## Routing Protocol (EIGRP)

- Cisco Proprietary:

- Fast Coverage:

- Composite Metric

### Open Shortest Path First (OSPF)

- link-state protocol:

- design:

- fast convergence:

## Route selection

- Metric-Based:

- Multiple Criteria:

- Dynamic Adjustment:

### Administrative distance

- Trust:

- Conflict Resolution:

- Protocol Preference:

### Prefix length

- specificity:

- Routing Decisions:

- CIDR Notation:

### Metric

## Address translation

### NAT

- Address Translation: translates private IP addresses to public IP addresses for internet access

- Security:

- IP Conservation:

### Port address translation (PAT)

- Many-to-One NAT: multiple devices on a LAN map to a single public IP address using different ports

- Port Mapping:

- Efficient Utilization:

## First Hop Redundancy Protocol (FHRP)

- Redundancy: provides redundancy for default gateway services, ensuring network availability

- Failover:

- Protocols:

## Virtual IP (VIP)

- Shared Addresses:

- Failover Capability:

- Load Balancing:

## Subinterfaces

- Logical Interfaces: multiple logical interfaces on a single physical interface, each with own IP address.

- VLAN support:

- Efficient Use:
