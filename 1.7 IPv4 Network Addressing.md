# 1.7 Network Addressing

> Given a scenario, use appropriate IPv4 network addressing.

## Public vs. private

### Automatic Private IP Addressing (APIPA)

- Automatic Assignment: assigns an IP address from the 169.254.0.0/16 range when DHCP server is unavailable

- Local: enables local network communication within the same subnet but not beyond.

- Fallback: Provides a fallback but not beyond.

### RFC1918

- Private IP Ranges: defines private IP addresses ranges not routable on the public internet (10.0.0.0/8, 172.16.0.0/12, 192.168.0.0/16).

- Internal Networks: used for internal network communications to conserve public IP addresses

- NAT Required: Network Address Translation (NAT) to communicate with external networks

### Loopback/localhost

- Self-Testing: IP address 127.0.0.1, used for self-testing & diagnostics on a local machine.

- Local communications: allows a device to send network traffic to itself for testing purposes.

- Standard addresses: universally recognized & used in network configurations & troubleshooting

## Subnetting

### Variable Length Subnet Mask (VLSM)

- Efficient IP allocation: IP addresses allocation by using subnet masks of variable lengths.

- Flexibility: provides flexibility in network design by supporting subnets of different sizes.

- IP conservation: helps conserve IP addresses by minimizing waste in address space allocation.

### Classless Inter-domain Routing (CIDR)

- IP addresses: replaces IP address classes with more flexible system of IP address allocation

- prefix notation: uses prefix notation ( /24) to specify the network portion of an IP address.

- Route summarization: uses to reduce the size of routing tables

## IPv4 address classes

### Class A

- Large Networks: designed for very large networks with default subnet masks of 255.0.0.0

- address range: includes IP addresses from 1.0.0.0 to 126.0.0.0

- High number of hosts: supports over 16 million hosts per network

### Class B

- medium-sized networks: intended for medium sized networks with a default subnet mask of 255.255.0.0

- address range: include IP addresses from 128.0.0.0 to 191.255.0.0

- moderate number of hosts: supports up to 65,534 hosts per network.

### Class C

- small networks: suitable for small networks with a default subnet mask of 255.255.255.0

- address range: includes IP addresses from 192.0.0.0 to 223.255.255.0

- limited hosts: supports up to 254 hosts per network.

### Class D

- Multicast: reserved for multicast groups rather than traditional hosts addressing

- address range: includes ip addresses from 224.0.0.0 to 239.255.255.255

- one-to-many used for applications requiring one-to-many communications, like streaming

### Class E

- Experimental use: reserved for experimental & research purposes, not used in general networking.

- address range include IP addresses from 240.0.0.0 to 255.255.255.255

- future use: intended for future use, though not widely implemented in practice.
