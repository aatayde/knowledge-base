### Cable speeds

- Variety of speeds: ranges from ethernet speeds (10 Mbps) to high-speed options like 100 Gbps
- Cable type: speed varies by cable type, such as Cat5e, Cat6, Cat6a, & fiber optic fables
- Application Specific: Higher speeds are essential for applications requiring fast data transfer \* low latency

### Plenum vs. non-plenum cable

#### Plenum Cable

- Fire-Resistant: Designed to be fire-resistant and produce minimal smoke & toxic fumes
- Regulatory Compliance: Required for use where air circulation is present, meeting strict building codes
- Safety: Enhances safety by reducing the risk of fire propagation in buildings.

## Transceivers

- signal conversion electrical to optical or vice versa
- Modular design, easy upgrades & replacements
- compatibility, standardized

### Protocol

#### Ethernet
